Flixel Blobs
============

Just some demonstration code for doing semi-blobby objects in Flixel 2.50.

The interesting code is in the src/BlobbyGroup.as file.

Basically, for each camera, we blur the contents, then use the alpha as a threshold. 

Using Gaussian blobby sprites would probably look better.
